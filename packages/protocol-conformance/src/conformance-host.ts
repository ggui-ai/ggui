/**
 * `ConformanceHost` — the seam between the kit's authored fixtures
 * and the implementation under test.
 *
 * Most fixtures declare `setup` / `teardown` directives (see
 * {@link SetupStep} / {@link TeardownStep} in `./types`) that the host
 * dispatches against its live server. v1.0 of the kit does NOT
 * require implementations to ship a host — fixtures that need setup
 * directives skip cleanly when `runConformance()` is called without
 * a `host`.
 *
 * When a host IS provided, the runner calls `dispatchSetup()` for
 * every step before driving the fixture's `inputEnvelope`, then
 * `dispatchTeardown()` for every step after the assertion. Unknown
 * `kind` values MUST throw so unimplemented directives surface as a
 * test SKIP with a clear "host does not implement X" reason — never
 * a silent pass.
 *
 * ## Extensibly-closed
 *
 * The concrete step vocabulary below mirrors `./types`' vocabulary
 * but is re-exported here as a host-facing narrower form:
 *   - Every arm carries the full semantic payload (not the JSON-
 *     loader's `unknown`-fields view).
 *   - The tail `(Record<string, unknown> & { readonly kind: string & {} })`
 *     catches fixture-JSON directives the host hasn't wired — the host
 *     returns by throwing, the runner maps it to a skip.
 *
 * Third-party hosts MAY extend either union with additional arms by
 * augmenting the declaration in their own module. v1.0 of the kit
 * does not require exhaustive coverage — it requires *honest*
 * coverage: either implement the directive OR throw, never silently
 * succeed on an unknown kind.
 *
 * ## Relation to `./types`
 *
 * `./types` defines the JSON-authoring surface: every directive has
 * optional-by-default fields so JSON authors don't have to think
 * about shape. This module defines the *runtime* surface: once the
 * loader has validated a directive, the host receives a narrowed
 * form. The two are intentionally parallel but not identical — JSON
 * loaders accept what the author wrote; hosts receive what the
 * runner confirmed is shape-valid.
